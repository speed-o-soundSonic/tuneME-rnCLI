# tuneME

This was my final project during my training course at WBS Coding School.

I created a mobile app which fetches videos from YouTube and is able to download and store it in the device.

To implement the downloading I created a quick backend deployed to `Heroku` using a library that pipes the video stream to my frontend.
In my frontend I then catch that stream and store it in the device.

I used `react-native-cli` for this project therefore I cannot deploy it just for demostration purposes. 

A presentation of my project can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Kgt7iK0rkZY?t=3360). The presentation only lasts 5 minutes.
